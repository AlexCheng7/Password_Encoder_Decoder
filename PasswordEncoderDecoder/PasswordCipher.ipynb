    "Extra Credit: This in particular was more difficult because I tried to combine multiple concepts from class and then expand further upon them such as ciphers, checking punctuations, and importing multiple files. Making sure the user could have lenient inputs for typing encode was hard as I had to almost essentially search for the word itself after lowercasing it. Furthermore, I made it so the user could encode at least 10 times which was hard to keep track of it and then I had to create a way where the program could use a set of inputs to then reverse the encode, printing out the original password. Going through password checks and determining strength based on what characters was used or how much repetition was also difficult to do."
